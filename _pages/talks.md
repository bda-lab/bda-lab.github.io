<!-- <h3>Introduction to Machine Learning</h3>
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/Class/10701-20/">[Course Website]</a>
<p>Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that automatically improve their performance through experience (e.g., programs that learn to recognize human faces, recommend music and movies, and drive autonomous robots). This course covers the theory and practical algorithms for machine learning from a variety of perspectives. We cover topics such as Linear Regression, SVMs, Neural Networks, Graphical Models, Clustering, etc. Programming assignments include hands-on experiments with various learning algorithms. This course is designed to give a PhD-level student a thorough grounding in the methodologies, technologies, mathematics and algorithms currently needed by people who do research in machine learning.</p> -->
