This research center at [International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/) (IIITB) focuses on various aspects of Information Management including developing scalable Big Data processing architectures and building systems & methods to manage & process structured, semi-structured, & unstructured high-velocity data for distributed data analytics. The “Big” here refers to not just the volume of data, but also challenges concerning the variety, veracity, and velocity of the data. The center revived in 2021 and is headed by [Professor Vinu E. Venugopal](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty/dr-vinu-e-venugopal).


This center was originally established in 2019 with Prof. Srinath Srinivasa as the founding member to enable collaboration between IIIT Bangalore, with [City University London](https://www.city.ac.uk/), as the UK partner, and Siemens Research, India, as the industry partner. Currently, in addition to the Royal engineering FCRA grant, the center is supported by several other grants and funding. Earlier projects carried out in this center can be found on the [WSL website](http://wsl.iiitb.ac.in/co-creation-of-a-center-of-excellence-in-big-data-engineering/).
