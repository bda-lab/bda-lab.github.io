Welcome to the ScaDS (Scalable Data Science) Lab! ScaDS is a research laboratory founded by [Prof. Vinu E. Venugopal](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty/dr-vinu-e-venugopal) in 2021 at [International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/) (IIITB). The ScaDS team primarily focuses on developing scalable solutions for various big data problems. The “Big” here refers to not just the volume of data, but also challenges concerning the variety, veracity, and velocity of the data. 

This laboratory is a part of the [Big Data Research Center](http://wsl.iiitb.ac.in/cds/index.php/Big_Data_Research_Center) established by [Prof. Srinath Srinivasa](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty/srinath-srinivasa) in 2019 to enable collaboration between IIIT Bangalore, with [City University London](https://www.city.ac.uk/), as the UK partner, and Siemens Research, India, as the industry partner. Currently, in addition to the Royal engineering FCRA grant, the lab is supported by several other grants and funding. Earlier projects carried out in the Big Data Research Center can be found on the [WSL website](http://wsl.iiitb.ac.in/co-creation-of-a-center-of-excellence-in-big-data-engineering/).
